# tinnitus-attenuator-ui

Disclaimer
----------
I am not a doctor or a neurologist and I developed this program because I have tinnitus. 
As you can read in: Where does this program come from?, I read a research article that reported positive results for people which tinnitus frequency was < 8Khz.

IF YOU USE THIS PROGRAM, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Do not listen the sounds too loud.

What is it?
-----------
This is the UI from the program: tinnitus-attenuator.
