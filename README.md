# tinnitus-attenuator-ui

Disclaimer
----------
I am not a doctor or a neurologist and I developed this program because I have tinnitus. 
As you can read in: [Where does this program come from?](https://github.com/cralcubo/tinnitus-atenuator#where-does-this-program-come-from), I read a research article that reported positive results for people which tinnitus frequency was < 8Khz.

**IF YOU USE THIS PROGRAM, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

Do not listen loud sounds :-)

What is it?
-----------
This is the UI from the program: [tinnitus-attenuator](https://github.com/cralcubo/tinnitus-atenuator).
